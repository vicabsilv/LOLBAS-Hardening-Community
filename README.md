# LOLBAS Hardening - Community Edition

**A community-led project to filter and enforce PowerShell-based hardening rules for blocking or restricting LOLBAS (Living Off The Land Binaries And Scripts).**

> Inspired by John Hammond's video walkthrough and real-world blue team implementation needs.

## Overview

LOLBAS is a collection of legitimate Windows binaries that can be abused for malicious purposes. Blocking or restricting these tools can improve endpoint resilience but may also affect system stability. This project aims to:

- Maintain a list of **blockable LOLBAS binaries** that do not break system functionality
- Provide **PowerShell hardening scripts** for Windows Defender Firewall or endpoint control
- Allow community **submissions, testing, and validation**
